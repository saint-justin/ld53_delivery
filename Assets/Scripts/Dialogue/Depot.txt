Boss/Kid
Boss: Welcome to the company, kid. I reckon you want to know how this all works. 
Kid: Is this the part where I get rich?
Boss: Ha, probably not.
Boss: First you go to the Depot. You can fill up yer' mech with as much equipment and cargo as you can fit.
Boss: There are rules, of course. Weapons go in the arms, thrusters go in the legs. 
Kid: But I want a cannon hat!
Boss: Absolutely no cannon hats. Do you want us all to go to jail? 
Kid: ...no.
Boss: Good. Anything in yer' hat's in the shade, immune to heat damage. And cargo in your belt is worth DOUBLE.
Kid: Yipee!
Boss: That's yer' one yipee for the fiscal year, hope you enjoyed it. Now load up that mech!
